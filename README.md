# extractpdf
A python package focused on extracting content out of PDF files.

There seems to be [many options out there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34837707/how-to-extract-text-from-a-pdf-file), but no single solution that is easy to install, even on Windows, and focus specifically on PDF files. So we have created this extractpdf package.

It is based on [Textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract) structure, but focuses on PDF only, and adds also other tools to the pipline, such as [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/) and [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
